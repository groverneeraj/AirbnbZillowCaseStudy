Software Required: Latest version of R language and RStudio for running and executing the markdown file

Please follow the below instructions to run the markdown file and generate the data case study output html file (I've already included my output file for reference)

Step 1: Please paste "listings.csv" and "zillow.csv" files in the downloaded folder i.e the folder should contain the data files with the MainFile.rmd file and the airbnb data file should be in .csv format

Step 2: Open the MainFile.rmd using RStudio app and then click on knit icon on the top to generate the html file. 

Although the MainFile.rmd file itself contains code to install and load all the necessary packages but in case there is an error then please make sure below packages are installed and loaded.
	
1. data.table
2. dplyr
3. ggplot2
4. tidyr
5. ggthemes
6. GGally
7. Matrix
8. plotly
9. naniar

Step 3: You can either view the html file in browser or using using R's default viewer
